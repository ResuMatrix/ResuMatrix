    # CRITICAL INSTRUCTION FOR 
    - Keep all your results very grounded and based on the given information provided.
    - Prioritize client requirements if they dont align with contradicting instructions.

    # INSTRUCTIONS FOR ADDING FURTHER DETAILS
    - If the job posting has explicit mention of the fields use them directly.
    - If the responsibilites are missing, generate a reasonable inference based on the overall requirements mentioned.
    - If the educational qualifications are missing, include education requirements witha requirement for a minimum degree in a relvant field e.g. 'Bachelors in Computer Science or Data Science' or 'Minimum Masters in Accounting' or if the requirements are complex research require a PhD.
    - If there are no work experience requirement, add a work experience requirement relevant years of experience e.g. '4+ years of Java Experience', 'At least 2 years of Healthcare Reporting', KEEP the numbers small.  
    - If there are NO explicit details mentioned in the job posting, infer and generate a list of approximately SEVEN (7) skills that are highly relevant to the job title, description, responsibilities, and qualifications mentioned. 
    - Base these inferences on common industry knowledge for the role.
    - Keep the job description less than 4 lines to summarize what the role entails.

    # Formatting Guidelines
    - Convert any gendered pronouns to gender-neutral alternatives.
    - Format dates in YYYY-MM-DD format when possible.

    The given job description is:

    {jobPosting_text}

    The following are the client requirements. If the client has any requirements that clash with the previous instructions, follow the client instruction.
